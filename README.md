## About Me
> I am experienced in large-scale data analysis and adept at using tools such as Power BI to support strategic, data-driven decision-making. At Accenture, I have worked closely with cross-functional teams to deliver seamless system releases, safeguard data integrity, and resolve complex UAT issues that impact project efficiency and business outcomes.

> Alongside my project work, I have a strong interest in cloud technologies and enjoy exploring new technical fields from scratch. I actively use AI as a learning partner to experiment, build different solutions, and turn ideas into real, working projects. I have also pursued multiple cloud certifications to deepen my technical fluency and broaden the value I bring to my teams.

> My goal is to continue combining my finance and data analysis background with cloud-driven and AI-enabled innovation to solve problems, optimise performance, and create meaningful impact.
